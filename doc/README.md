This document is a compilation of notes from contributors, [CTLT](http://ctlt.ubc.ca/) meetings and consultations with users:

Current Todos
============================

- Improve the way entity updates are handled (for all controllers)
    - Currently the merge() approach used by `Ipeer\UserBundle\User` the leading choice
        - This choice may be inefficient in SQL if only one field is being updated
        - Figure out a way to control which fields are allowed to be updated (this is the "reverse" version of the "conditional-based deserialization rules" listed in this section)
- Improve error messages returned from server
    - Could be used client-side or even in debugging/testing
- Test cascading deletes wherever relevant (eg. course delete triggers groups-within-that-course delete)
    - If not working, choose a good way to do that (possibly via doctrine entity annotations)
- Review PHPdoc and APIdoc for entities and controllers
- Write general tests (not controller specific):
    - Data return format
    - 404
    - bad HTTP method
- Clean up existing tests:
    - Fix assertEquals to be in correct format (ie. $this->assertEquals(expected, actual))
        - Also for assertCount and other test conditions
    - Add more custom fail messages where appropriate
    - Separate tests into more methods and collapse/trim redundant ones
    - Look into reducing memory usage of tests
- Improve test coverage and code cleanliness (where it makes sense): https://codeclimate.com/github/cisdev2/ipeer4-server
    - Add more tests to check for valid fields on an individual basis (eg. check everything-valid except for email in an User update)
- Decide on table names (currently some ones like the join tables are explicitly chosen in the ORM PHPDoc comments, others are generated by doctrine)
- Add code-style check to build process or manually-on-save (php-cs-fixer and also [SensioLabsInsight](https://insight.sensiolabs.com/) which is free for Open-Source)
- Find way to control deserialization ("conditional-based deserialization rules") 
    - Note: jmsserializer has the "groups" features - check whether there is a way to specify the group via annotations in a controller
    - Purpose 1: When some entity properties should not be deserialized for a user of low privilege level
    - Purpose 2: When entities are in a relationship, the referenced object should be deserialized differently (eg. when a faculty lists its departments, the departments should be serialized differently from when they are accessed directly)

Remaining Features
============================

Not listed in any particular order:

- Implement authentication and access system
    - Use Symfony tokens
    - Use ACL for data-specific access
    - Permissions manager or configuration (similar to iPeer3 permissions manager)
    - OAuth access
    - Encourage whitelist approach instead of blacklisting
- New evaluation event logic
    - Within-group (existing)
    - Self-evaluation only (new)
    - Evaluate another group
        - Evaluate X other groups
- Revised evaluation template system
    - Implement creation of templates
    - Implement completion (by students/tutors) of templates
    - Consolidate 4 types (simple, rubric, survey, mixed) into a single type
    - Add new types of questions (make the system extensible for adding new types)
        - Change simple evaluation to be $X per group, not $X per member (or make pie chart visualization)
    - Add tagging to templates for easier filtering/searching
- Add new role types
    - "UBC Grader" equivalent -> able to see results, but not able to create events, etc
    - "UBC Builder" equivalent -> able to create events, but cannot see results
- Revised emailing system 
    - Rethink email templates (possibly remove the option in some contexts)
    - Create email at various stages in process (event started, due date approaching, results availability)
    - Instructors should access a per-course log to see the history of sent emails (to answer the question "Am I spamming students?"
- Help & Resources Website:
    - The UBC CIS should develop a website to encourage better use of iPeer and peer evaluation in general
    - The site could also serve as the help/support/documentation resource
- Improved event result feedback
    - Course wide dashboard indicating trends (are students getting better over time?)
    - Each event should have a dashboard with stats (completion rate, average scores, median, mode, etc)
        - Research should be done to find which metrics are useful to instructors
    - Score manipulation / generation: normalization, include/exclude self-evaluation, remove outliers (remove highest and lowest score)
    - New export type (possible multi-sheet Excel with dashboard stats, graphs and raw data)
    - Issue detection (gaming of system, group dysfunction detection, overestimating-your-own-contribution detection, profanity in comments, etc)
    - Instructors can give per event (class-wide) or per student feedback for students to see beside their results
    - Late penalty system adjustment
        - Clearer settings
        - No submission? -> Automatic zero (even if other people rated you)
    - Student result view analytics (did students check their results)?
- Implement new and missing course management features:
    - TeamMaker (should be more transparent about the process and should be implemented in PHP, not as an external program)
    - Event creation and management
    - Add course open/close dates (course gets hidden if "old")
    - Way to deal with group formation in multi-section courses where students can switch sections for a while
- Implement missing user management features:
    - Edit own profile
    - Faculties and departments
    - Merging users
    - Importing students/users
    - Granting system wide statuses

Big Picture / Long Term Ideas
===========================

- Track student over time (over various courses)
- Get TLEF funding to continue development  
- Once the majority of the code has been written, the code should be (further) modularized and decoupled, so we end up with bundles that are reusable (potentially by others) outside the iPeer context
- LTI integration (eg. edX, or iframe in Blackboard)
- Optimize Symfony for performance and scalability (possible multi-server setup)
- Look at what similar applications are doing (eg. [TEAMMATES](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/repo)) 
- Use something like "liwc" to analyze comment quality and/or mood
